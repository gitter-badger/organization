If you feel like you want to help out. Just add an issue on the right

## Preparation of meetup description (rough guidelines)

1. Always mention the North 3 elevator to get to the Knowledge salon ...(everybody mistakes that)
2. Even if people will attend the restaurant afterwards the chance is high that this will change later
3. The first paragraph should be cheerful about the event because its the first thing people read in their mails (and the first paragraph in general): no technical things.
4. The text should be formed with continuity in mind but also readable for first-timers.
5. Order of content: (A) Cheerful message (B) decided topics (C) recruiting (D) News (E) Information in case someone attends the meeting.
